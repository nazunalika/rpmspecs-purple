## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do you have any SRPMS available?

They'll normally be available from my copr builds, if you are interested in making changes and using mock for yourself.

### Have any documentation or guides?

If you're starting out rpm packaging, please consider reading the following documentation. The packaging guidelines may seem strict, but they are deemed best practices if you are considering on being a package maintainer (sponsored or not). Keep in mind, **I am always learning**. I am in no way an expert, nor do I claim to be.

[Fedora: Fedora Packaging Guidelines](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/)

[Fedora: Creating RPM Packages](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/package-maintainers/Packaging_Tutorial_GNU_Hello/)

What you should get from the above is there are specific guidelines that should be followed, for maintainability, portability, and easy review.

### Do you have any repositories?

Yes, I do.

[Copr](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/nalika/)

### Do you take requests?

I normally don't. But, if what you're asking for doesn't have an RPM or project in copr, I'll consider it based on what it is, and if it fits licensing and guidelines. You can drop me an email or a line here and I will get back to you.
